# angular website

My first look into web development. I jumped straight in using yeoman and began messing around with js, angular, and bootstrap.

## Install
```git clone https://github.com/wekilledit/angular-website.git .```  
```cd angular-website```  
```npm install```  
```bower install```  

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
